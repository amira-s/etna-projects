Hello,

This is some explanation about the overall job that we did as a bonus.

 We added a hard mode inspired form the Big bang theory TV show,
a multiplayer mode as well as a pretty interface with ascii art,
there's also a game menu with an option to dislpay the game rules. 
We have an overall pretty good error checking system and we also added a score 
counting system for the computer so that the game seems a bit more fair.
All this while respecting as much as possible the syntax restrictions ("norme") inspite the fact that this is shell scripting...

Hope you'll enjoy it :)
